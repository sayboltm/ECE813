priority inversion

	preemption - task is higher priority

Priority ceiling:
deadlock in the previous example can be prevented by a clever technique called the
priority ceiling protocol (Sha et al., 1990). In this protocol, every lock or semaphore is
assigned a priority ceiling equal to the priority of the highest-priority task that can lock it.
A task τ can acquire a lock a only if the task’s priority is strictly higher than the priority
ceilings of all locks currently held by other tasks. ( '>' not '>=')



Multiprocessor scheduling p344
Schedule a fixdd finite set of tasks with precedences on a finite number of processors to minimize makespan
where objective = minimize makespan
and   constraints = precidences

Hu level scheduling
Assigns a priority to each task tau based on the level, which is the greatest sum of execution times on a path in the precedence graph from tau to another task with no dependents. Tasks with larger levels have hihger priority

Scheduling Anomalies
Assign more processors => makespan should decrease

or reducing exec times of tasks => " " "

or relaxing procedure constraints => " " "
