# Setting up crazyflie V2.0 

https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/blob/develop/README.md

# Fork crazyflie-clients-python (web interface)
# Clone
git clone gh-sayboltm:sayboltm/crazyflie-clients-python.git

# Install the cflib in editable mode
	# Check version to know if pip is for python 2 or 3
	pip -V
	# If pip for python 3, continue
# pip install -e path/to/cflib   
pip install -e ~/GitHub/sayboltm/crazyflie-clients-python

# Uninstall the cflib (why?)
pip uninstall cflib

# TODO: Clarify: This probs needs to be installed in virtualenv bc sudo pip bad

# Attempting alternate install using conda venvs instead of virtualenv
# TODO: conda update conda flips a shit. fix/figure out. Proceeding with 3.19.1

# Create a venv with conda
conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x
#conda create -n crazyflie python=3.5.1
conda create -n crazyflie python=3.4 numpy=1.10.1 pyqt pyqtgraph

# Activate
source activate crazyflie

### Now we can actually do the cflib install

# Testing with docker and the toolbelt
# Check toolbelt
tb test
	# Install toolbelt
	#https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:dockerbuilderimage:index
	
		# Install Docker to contain the toolbelt
		#https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/#install-from-a-package
		
		# 1. Install packages to allow apt to use repo over https:
		sudo apt-get install \
		    apt-transport-https \
		    ca-certificates \
		    curl \
		    software-properties-common
		# NOTE: Was already latest version, didn't do anything

		# 2. Add Docker's GPG key	
		curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
		# Returns: 'OK'
			# Verify fingerprint from website
			sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

		# 3. Setup a stable repository
			# amd64: (armhf also available)
			sudo add-apt-repository \
   				"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   				$(lsb_release -cs) \
   				stable"

		# Install Docker
		# 1. Update apt package index
		sudo apt-get update
		
		# 2. Install latest version of docker
		sudo apt-get install docker-ce # docker-ee for enterprise

		# 2.5 OR for production systems, use specific version
		sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION>

		# Version used at time of this writing:
		# docker-ce_17.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial_amd64.deb
		# 17.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial

		# 4. Verify that Docker CE is working using hellow-world image
		sudo docker run hello-world

		# NOTE: need to use sudo to run docker commands
		# If undesired see:
		https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/
		
		# To update Docker:
		sudo apt-get update
		# follow this:
		https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/#install-docker
	# Back to toolbelt, now that we have docker
	# The only installation required is to add an alias to .profile or .bashrc so that commands are in your $PATH (just type into terminal and they run)
	docker run --rm -it bitcraze/toolbelt
	# Had to use sudo. Security issue?

	# tb test still doesn't work. Continue.

	# actually add the alias:

		# Open ~/.bashrc and paste:
# Added manually for crazyflie use/dev
alias tb='docker run --rm -it -e "HOST_CW_DIR=${PWD}" -e "CALLING_HOST_NAME=$(hostname)" -e "CALLING_UID"=$UID -e "CALLING_OS"=$(uname) -v ${PWD}:/tb-module -v ${HOME}/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock bitcraze/toolbelt'

		# This is what the program was telling you to add to add alias

	# Normally you have to logout/in to refresh bashrc. Just use:
	source ~/.bashrc
	# This refreshes for current terminal. So run in the one you want to useor open a new one
	
	# tb test now gets permission denied because not root
	# but don't want to use root bc infosec vuln
	# Set udev permissions (for linux)
	# TODO: Something is wrong here, need udev for usbplug .. and this?

	# TODO: tb doesn't work properly
		# Alias appears to be setup correctly despite error about it not
		# when running docker run --rm -it bitcraze/toolbelt
		# But tb -V works (???)
		# Won't run tb test, tb verify, returns:
		Error: Don't know how to execute <test|verify>

	# TODO: stuff with Tox

# Set udev (USB device) permission/behavior so can use USB Radio without root
# this is done by adding your normal usr to grp plugdev, then adding a rule
# in udev to allow access to users in grp plugdev
sudo groupadd plugdev
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev <username>
# i.e.: sudo usermod -a -G plugdev mike
# Might already be in there
groups mike

# Create and/or add the following rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/99-crazyradio.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1915", ATTRS{idProduct}=="7777", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"

# Create and/or add the following rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/99-crazyflie.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5740", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"
# That one is for plugging in the crazyflie to usb
# MAKE SURE TYPED CORRECTLY ELSE CFCLIENT WON'T SEE RADIO/CRAZYFLIE
# To view usb devices and see where some of those numbers come from:
lsusb

# Install extra dependencies
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-pyqt4 python3-zmq python3-pyqtgraph
sudo pip3 install pyusb==1.0.0b2
sudo pip3 install appdirs

# Might have to just use pip (no sudo) since inside venv
# Check with:
pip freeze

# OR USE CONDA. There is no consistency in CF documentation.
# Had issues installing those dependencies because the Anaconda3 folder was
# owned by root. Permission denied. Had to use chown to change to usr mike

# Beware conflicting documentation!!!!!! WTAF
# Above is from::
https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/blob/master/README.md

# But this says
https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/
# use pyqt5
conda install -c anaconda pyqt=5.6.0
# NOTE: This broke the version of Spyder that actually works... shit
# it wants pyqt4.6+ but < 5.0

# Run cfclient GUI
cd /path/to/crazyflie-clients-python
python bin/cfclient # assuming python -V returns a python3 (preferrably 3.4) from your venv
# BOOM.
