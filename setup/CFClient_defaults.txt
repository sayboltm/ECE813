CFClient settings on ubuntu:

Max angle/rate 30
Max yaw angle/rate 200
max thrust 80
min thrust 25

slew limit 45
thrust lowering slewrate 30 


Settings on windows 2014 version with xb1 controller awesome flight
# SAME. so crap PowerA controller or something else is bad flight experience on linux. Like weird issues mapping trigger to thrust
Max angle/rate 30
Max yaw angle/rate 200
max thrust 80
min thrust 25

slew limit 45
thrust lowering slewrate 30 

An attempt to reverse engineer these features:
Max angle/rate: as it sounds, your 'look speed'
Max Yaw angle/rate: your 'turn speed'
Max thrust (%): Duh. Note this is good to limit to figure out what it takes to takeoff with differnet payloads
Min Thrust (%): Duh. Don't turn up too much, else can't land.
SlewLimit: I presume to be an acceleration of sorts. Not figured out.
Thrust lowering slewrate (%/sec): I presume to be mandatory keeping of thrust once you back off the throttle. Test moar.


Supposed better flying:
Max angle/rate 30
Max Yaw angle/rate 200
Max thrust 70
Min thrust 25
SlewLimit 45
Thrust lowering slewrate 30
